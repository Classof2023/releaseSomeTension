<h1> Release Some Tension Album </h1>

<p> Release Some Tension is the third studio album by American R&B vocal group SWV. Guest appearances are made by E-40, Puff Daddy, Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Foxy Brown, Lil' Cease, Lil' Kim, Snoop Dogg and Redman.

The album features hits like "Rain", "Someone", "Can We" (which was originally included on the soundtrack for the Jamie Foxx film, Booty Call). Another single "Lose My Cool" was slated to be released as the album's third single but due to limited radio airplay it was shelved in favor of "Rain" which became one of their most notable hits.

"Someone", although featuring one of the biggest producers/artists of the year, Puff Daddy, only reached #19 on the Billboard charts. Group member Coko claimed "Someone" was a "half-assed song" in a 1997 interview shortly after the single's release. Nevertheless, the single was certified gold by the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.
The album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments exceeding 500,000 copies in the United States. </p>
